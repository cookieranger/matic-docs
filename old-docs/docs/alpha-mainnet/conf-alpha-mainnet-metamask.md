Configure Alpha Mainnet RPC

In order to view the flow of funds on the Matic Network using Matic.js, you will need to configure Matic’s alpha-mainnet URL on Metamask.

To add Matic’s Alpha-mainnet, click on the Network selection dropdown and then click on Custom RPC.

It will open up a form with 2 tabs on the top, Settings and Info. In the Settings tab you can add the URL `https://alpha.ethereum.matic.network`

Once you’ve added the URL in the New Network field, click on Save. You will be directly switched to Matic’s alpha-mainnet now in the network dropdown list. You can now close the dialog.
