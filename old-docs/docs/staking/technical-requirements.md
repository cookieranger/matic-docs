For the upcoming testnet event, this is the minimal hardware configuration:
> 4GB RAM 

> 100GB SSD

> x64 2.0 GHz 2v CPU
 
While we do not favor any operation system, more secure and stable Linux server distributions (like CentOS) should be preferred over desktop operating systems (like Mac OS and Windows).

We will provide more detailed information on the hardware setup in due course of time.
