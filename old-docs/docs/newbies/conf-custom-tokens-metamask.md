This page demonstrates the process of configuring/adding custom tokens to Metamask. Specifically, we have demonstrated adding the example `TEST` token to the Ropsten testnet as well as the Matic testnet. 

You can use this process to add any custom ERC20 tokens to any network on Metamask.

**Adding the `TEST` token (ERC20) to your Metamask account on Ropsten Network**

To display `TEST` tokens on your account on the Ropsten Network, you can click on the Add Tokens option in Metamask. It will then navigate you to a screen. You then click on Custom Token tab and copy-paste the address below in the Token Address field.

The `TEST` token contract address on Ropsten is `0x70459e550254b9d3520a56ee95b78ee4f2dbd846`. Note that the `TEST` token is an example ERC20 token contract that is used throughout the Matic Network developer docs for illustration purposes.

The other fields will auto-populate. Click on Save and then click on Add Tokens. The `TEST` token should now be displayed on your account on Metamask.

**Configuring `Matic TEST` tokens to Metamask**

You will also need to configure the `TEST` tokens to Maticâ€™s Testnet for visualization if you are following the introductory Matic.js tutorial. **Switch the network on Metamask to point to the Matic testnet - https://testnet2.matic.network **. On Metamask, this will be shown as `Private Network`.

The corresponding `TEST` token address on Matic testnet is `0xc82c13004c06e4c627cf2518612a55ce7a3db699`. Note that this token contract address is different from that of Ropsten - since this is the `TEST` token on the Matic Network. A detailed, screen-by-screen guide to add custom tokens is shown here:

You can open Metamask and then click on the option for Add Token.

You will see a screen to either search from a list of already available tokens or add a custom token. Click on Custom Token.

You will see a field to add the Token Address. Paste the token address in the form, and configure the token name as `TEST`.

You can then click on Next.

And then click on Add Tokens. You will be navigated back to the home screen and the new token will be displayed in the token list.
