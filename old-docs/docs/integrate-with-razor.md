# Integrate Oracles in your DApp

Matic network is functionally fully compatible with Razor Network, a decentralized network of validators providing data to the network. Read more about the technical details here: https://docs.razor.network/

The oracle network is currently running on GÃ¶rli testnet. A "[Bridge](https://github.com/razor-network/bridge)", picks results from the network and delivers them to Matic Network. 
To get started with connecting to the data feed, check out this tutorial: https://docs.razor.network/tutorial/matic/; corresponding code available at: https://github.com/razor-network/king-of-crypto. The bridge has been updated with more features and linked to razorscan https://matic.razor.network/ (Make sure to connect metamask to matic testnet!)

If you'd like to get a feel of a DApp first, a sample DApp is deployed at https://matic-king.netlify.com/ (Make sure to connect Metamask to Matic testnet (`http://testnet2.matic.network`))
