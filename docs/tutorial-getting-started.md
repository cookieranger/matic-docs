title: Welcome to Matic's DApp Development
sidebar_label: Getting Started
---

Welcome to the most exciting, ingenious invention and fasting growing technology ever, "Matic Blockchain". Blockchain technology is poised to revolutionise the way the digital world handles data and does business. Be a part of this revolution and head start with Decentralise-App development.

If this is overwhelming, that’s okay! You can jump right into the fire and start hacking. Here are a few pointers before you start diving into resources, repositories, and documentation.

1. **Beware the cost of being on the bleeding edge** More so than typical niche programming, dapp and blockchain development moves very quickly. Deep into learning, you may find complex code repositories, 404s on a documentation site, or, perhaps, no documentation at all. Rather than seeing this as a deterrent, see it as an invitation to a **Opportunity**. Ping on our developer channel, find the Discord / Gitter / Telegram channel, post on Stack Overflow or Reddit — you may be surprised at the rate of response and openness of the community.
2. **The learning curve may be daunting, but the barrier to entry is low**. All communities have their grumps, of course, but if you do the work, put in the effort, it will be noticed. Projects welcome pull requests from outsiders and support will be there if you’ve exhausted every other resource. We’re working on creating a better world and can use all the help we can get. We’re just glad you’re here.

What are you waiting for? Let's get started!!!

We divided learning dapp development into two sections: learning and keeping up with Matic & Blockchain development. The first resources help you understand the similarities and differences from Web 2 to Web 3 (as blockchain is commonly called). The second are resources to keep up with that development.

# **Learning Dapp Development**

### QuickStart

For developers who want to learn about building on Matic or Ethereum. The Tutorials available will teach you how to write a smart contract, deploy it to Matic or Ethereum, and interact with the contracts through a web-based application.

### **Get Involved with Hackathons**

Hackathons take place at blockchain conferences and meetups all over the world. Chances are you can’t hop on a plane on a moment’s notice, but some conferences or projects host virtual hackathons open to anyone with an internet connection.

### **Meet-ups**

Some meetups are more about trading “investment” advice but a good technical meetup in your area is an excellent way to meet other people interested in Dapp development.

# **Keeping Up with Development**

### **Social Media**

Dapp development encourages network decentralization, and it also embodies it. Developers are located everywhere in the world! As such, social media has become important to keep people in touch across time zones. Besides the popular platforms, you may be less familiar with platforms such as Telegram, Discord and Gitter.
