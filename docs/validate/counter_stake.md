Counter Stake will be conducted in 3 stages - stages 0, 1 and 2:

### **Stage 0** – Setup

We want all validators to run the Validator and Block Producer nodes, keep them synced with the given testnet, understand the network, try deploying your own testnet and experiment with the code.

**Date: Nov-Dec 2019**

You can already try setting up your node. We will inform you when we update our public testnet and you can then download the new genesis file. Get the current one from here: [https://github.com/maticnetwork/public-testnets/CS-1000](https://github.com/maticnetwork/public-testnets/CS-1000)

### **Stage 1** – Stake on the Beach

We’ll release the staking contract details for everyone here. The aim is that we gradually release incremental features of the Validator nodes. We begin with staking – accepting participants to be in the active validator set. This will be followed by unlocking rewards, penalties and replacement strategies progressively. All rules, conditions and evaluation details will be provided before the stage commences. We will let you know to post the evaluation and testing of the internal testnet network which we will be running in parallel with Stage 0 – in terms of what problems occur, if any, and accounting for bug resolution time and refactoring. We thank you for your patience so far and want you to know that the only reason we do not want to hurry is to minimize issues while running the event.

### **Stage 2** – The Grand Staking League

Hopefully, by this time, we would have made our network stronger, resolved all queries faced so far and will be ready to begin with the final contest. All validators start at the same level in terms of testnet tokens allotted for staking. The one with the most stake in the end wins!

**The date is to be decided.**

## **Prizes**

More than 3 million mainnet MATIC tokens will be shared with the winners and participants of Stages 1 and 2. Criteria and other details for the Counter Stake prizes will be shared along with the rules and conditions before we commence each stage. Special bug bounties as per individual contribution will be given as well – so do show off your hacking skills!

You are most welcome to help us build components for the ecosystem. Separate bounties via the [Developer Support Program](https://blog.matic.network/matic-developer-support-program/) will also be made available for such third-party components.
