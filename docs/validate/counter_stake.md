Counter Stake will be conducted in 3 stages - stages 0, 1 and 2:

### **Stage 0** – Setup

We want all validators to run the Validator and Block Producer nodes, keep them synced with the given testnet, understand the network, try deploying your own testnet and experiment with the code.

**Date: Nov-Dec 2019** 
**Status**: Completed


### **Stage 1** – Stake on the Beach
**Date**: (Feb - Apr 2020)
**Status**: Completed

We’ll release the staking contract details for everyone here. The aim is that we gradually release incremental features of the Validator nodes. We begin with staking – accepting participants to be in the active validator set. This will be followed by unlocking rewards, penalties and replacement strategies progressively. All rules, conditions and evaluation details will be provided before the stage commences. We will let you know to post the evaluation and testing of the internal testnet network which we will be running in parallel with Stage 0 – in terms of what problems occur, if any, and accounting for bug resolution time and refactoring. We thank you for your patience so far and want you to know that the only reason we do not want to hurry is to minimize issues while running the event.

### **Stage 2** – The Grand Staking League
**Date**: April
**Status**: Ongoing

Stage 2 is the final and last stage of Counter Stake, Matic's incentivized testnet staking program. This is the stage where we will encourage validators and the community to perform "Attacks" and "Break the system" notions.
