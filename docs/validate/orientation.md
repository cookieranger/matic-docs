Counter Stake is conducted in 3 stages - stages 0, 1 and 2:

### **Stage 0** – Setup

We want all validators to run the Validator and Block Producer nodes, keep them synced with the given testnet, understand the network, try deploying your own testnet and experiment with the code.

**Date: Nov-Dec 2019** 
**Status**: Completed

You can already try setting up your node. We will inform you when we update our public testnet and you can then download the new genesis file. Get the current one from here: [https://github.com/maticnetwork/public-testnets/CS-1000](https://github.com/maticnetwork/public-testnets/CS-1000)

### **Stage 1** – Stake on the Beach 
**Date**: (Feb - Apr 2020)
**Status**: Completed

We’ll release the staking contract details for everyone here. The aim is that we gradually release incremental features of the Validator nodes. We begin with staking – accepting participants to be in the active validator set. This will be followed by unlocking rewards, penalties and replacement strategies progressively. All rules, conditions and evaluation details will be provided before the stage commences. We will let you know to post the evaluation and testing of the internal testnet network which we will be running in parallel with Stage 0 – in terms of what problems occur, if any, and accounting for bug resolution time and refactoring. We thank you for your patience so far and want you to know that the only reason we do not want to hurry is to minimize issues while running the event.

### **Stage 2** – The Grand Staking League
**Date**: April
**Status**: Ongoing

Stage 2 is the final and last stage of Counter Stake, Matic's incentivized testnet staking program. This is the stage where we will encourage validators and the community to perform "Attacks" and "Break the system" notions. In order to know about Stage 2, you can join our discord channel for more details: https://discord.gg/XvpHAxZ

You are most welcome to help us build components for the ecosystem. Separate bounties via the [Developer Support Program](https://blog.matic.network/matic-developer-support-program/) will also be made available for such third-party components.

## Jump to the Essentials

The following list will give you a headstart to know more about Matic

#### Reward program details

Understand the different objectives and activities that are aligned for Counter Stake - Stage 2. There are Objective and Subjective tasks and each of them include a different bounty to it. We have writted a detailed post about all the rewards that are applicable for Stage 2.

#### What is Matic?

[Matic Network](https://matic.network/) is a Layer 2 scaling solution that achieves scale by utilizing sidechains for off-chain computation while ensuring asset security using the Plasma framework and a decentralized network of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) validators.

#### Architecture

In order to perform attacks (correctly) we would encourage Validators and community members to understand Matic's Architecture and Code thoroughly. Without the thorough understanding of Core Components such as Heimdall and Bor, it would be difficult to perform attacks correctly on the network.
