Matic Network is a scaling solution for public blockchains. Based on an adapted implementation of Plasma framework (Plasma MoreVP) - with an account based implementation (read more here), Matic supports all the existing Ethereum tooling along with faster and cheaper transactions.

If you are looking to become a Validator by setting your node for Matic or to become a Delegator to delegate tokens toward a validator and earn rewards, then you have come to the right place.

## To Become a Validator

Lets get you started on understand what's under the hood of Matic Network.

#### Architecture

In order to perform attacks (correctly) we would encourage Validators and community members to understand Matic's Architecture and Code thoroughly. Without the thorough understanding of Core Components such as Heimdall and Bor, it would be difficult to perform attacks correctly on the network. 

Please refer [this link](/docs/validate/validator/architecture) for more details. 


#### Specs
In order to understand the granular information about core components such as Heimdall, Bor and Contracts you can head over to the link below. This will not only help you understand how Matic works under-the-hood but also help you to execute attacks correctly

You can navigate to the specs with these links:

- [Heimdall](/docs/contribute/heimdall/overview)
- [Bor](/docs/contribute/bor/overview)
- [Contracts](https://docs.matic.today/docs/contribute/contracts/stakingmanager)

#### Codebases

Codebase of Matic to understand the granular interaction of how Matic's core components work.

- Heimdall: https://github.com/maticnetwork/heimdall
- Bor: https://github.com/maticnetwork/bor
- Contracts: https://github.com/maticnetwork/contracts

Once you have familiarised with the Architecture and Specs and Codebase, you can setup your node. Note that the documentation above is to only to get you familiarised with how the Internals of Matic works, you directly setup your node without getting familiarised with the Specs above. 

#### Setup your node

**Setup your Full Node**

> * **Option 1:** [Linux Package Installation](https://docs.matic.network/docs/validate/counter-stake-stage-2/linux-package-installation) (Recommended; lightweight, native)
> * **Option 2:** [Running with Binaries](https://docs.matic.network/docs/validate/counter-stake-stage-2/running-with-binaries) (Relatively complex to setup, but offers advanced 

**Stake on Matic**

Stake tokens to become a validator - [follow this guide](https://docs.matic.network/docs/validate/counter-stake-stage-2/stake-on-matic)

## To become a Delegator

Delegators are token holders who cannot, or do not want to run a validator themselves. They can delegate staking tokens to a validator and obtain a part of their revenue in exchange.

Here is a Step-By-Step guide to help you become a delegator on Matic's incentivised testnet program. There are no pre-requisites required to become a delegator on Matic. All you have to do is have an Ethereum account.
