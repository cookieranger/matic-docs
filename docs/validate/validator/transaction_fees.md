Each block producer at Bor will be given a certain percentage of the transaction fees collected in each block. 

Selection of producers for any given span is also dependent on the validator’s ratio in the overall stake. The remaining transaction fees flow through the same funnel as the rewards which get shared among all validators working at the Heimdall layer. 

What exact percentage of transaction fees will be shared with every block producer will be decided at a later point in time taking into consideration the overall statistics of the live network. Until then, the transaction fees flow through the same funnel disbursing everything collected among all validators.
