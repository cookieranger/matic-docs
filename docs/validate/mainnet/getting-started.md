Hey everyone! Matic Mainnet is here - Get ready to run Validator nodes on the Matic Mainnet!

We have been working hard on enabling the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) layer on the Matic Network, and we are launching our public  staking to the community

To participate and become a responsible validator by running a node on the the Matic Mainnet you can follow the documentation here

Please ensure that you read the documentation carefully before starting the setup for the nodes.

Node setup guide: https://docs.matic.network/docs/validate/mainnet/validator-guide

**Stake on Matic**

Before you initiate the staking process, ensure that your node's health check is complete. Please perform a health check by joining the Discord Server and contacting one of the admins (Delroy)
