A validator is a participant in the network who locks up tokens in the network and runs validator nodes in order to help run the network.

A Blockchain Validator is someone who is responsible for verifying transactions within a blockchain. For Matic Network, any participant can be qualified to became a Matic's validator by running a full-node to earn Rewards and Transaction fee. To ensure Good Participation by Validators, they lock up some of their Matic Tokens as a stake in the ecosystem.

As a validator running nodes on Matic, you are subject to host of responsibilities in order to ensure the network runs appropriately and securely.

Following are some of the responsibilities of a Validator on Matic

### Maintaining High Uptime

Uptime on Matic Network is calculated upon the number of Checkpoints transactions that a Validator has signed for. Approximately every 34 minutes a checkpoint is to be submitted by a proposer to the Ethereum Mainchain. This checkpoint transaction is supposed to be signed by every validator on the network. Failure to sign a checkpoint or missing a checkpoint will result in decrease of your performance.

This process is currently automated, however, in order to ensure that your Node is active and signs all the checkpoints you need to ensure that all the services for your Matic Validator node are running correctly.

### Daily checks of Services and Processes

There are several services and processes that run in the backgroung / foreground when your Validator node is up and running
