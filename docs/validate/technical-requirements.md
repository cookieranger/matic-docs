For the upcoming testnet event, this is the minimal hardware configuration:
:::tip Minimal hardware Configuration for Validator Node
8 GB RAM 

100GB SSD

x64 2.0 GHz 2v CPU
:::

:::tip Minimal hardware Configuration for Sentry Node
8 GB RAM 

60GB SSD

x64 2.0 GHz 4v CPU
:::


While we do not favor any operating system, more secure and stable Linux server distributions (like CentOS) should be preferred over desktop operating systems (like Mac OS and Windows).

We will provide more detailed information on the hardware setup in due course of time.

:::note
Requirements like storage space will change over time
