For all attacks and bugs that are performed/discovered you will need to report them to this Google Form: https://forms.gle/Tnq8KQDhq6s1CYBD9 . Performing an attack and not providing submission of your proof will result in disqualification of your attempt. 

You need to make sure that you add all relevant details such as Email address and Discord id so as to maintain a rapport of communication in case it's required.

You would also need to provide as much details as possible so that the Matic Team can evaluate your submission appropriately.

Upon reporting an issue, the Matic Project team will review and update/comment on the status of the issue. Upon evaluation, the Matic team will report the outcome of the submission. The Severity will also be tagged as per the evaluation.

For any further questions, you can always connect with the Community Leaders Anurag & Delroy on Discord or through email.
