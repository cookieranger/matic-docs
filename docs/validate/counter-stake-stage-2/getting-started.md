Hey everyone! Counter Stake is here - Get ready to run Validator nodes on the Matic testnet!

We have been working hard on enabling the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) layer on the Matic Network, and we are launching our public incentivized staking testnet event [Counter Stake](https://matic.network/counter-stake/). 

To participate in the public testnet event, you will first need to register yourself here: https://matic.network/counter-stake-registration

Once you register yourself, you need not setup your nodes for Matic right away. You will be contacted via email when you are added to the validator list. If you setup your node before being added to the validator list, you will face problems during staking.
 
~~**Stage 0 - Setup (Ended)**~~

~~This is mainly to help everyone setup their own nodes and understand the functioning of the network.~~

~~You may set up your node using any one of the following options:~~ 

~~> * **Option 1:** Linux Package Installation (Recommended; lightweight, native)~~

~~> * **Option 2:** Running with Docker (Easy to set up, but a bit resource intensive)~~

~~> * **Option 3:** Running with Binaries (Relatively complex to setup, but offers advanced customization)~~

~~Please note that this stage is only for you to setup your Full Node and checkout the network status. You may stop all services later and restart again to participate in later stages of Counter Stake.~~

Please note that if you were not part of Stage 0 or were unable to participate or register for Counter Stake during Stage 0, don't worry. You can still participate in Stage 1. You will need to join our [discord server](https://discord.gg/XvpHAxZ) and send us additional details on [this form](https://t.co/Ft80ZDdt6d)

We will be testing all features incrementally here; rewards, slashing, replacement and more. You will need to maintain your uptime and earn rewards as per your performance. For more details on rewards, you can read here: [Rewards](rewards)

**Stage 2 - The Grand Staking League** (Ongoing)

Stage 2 is the final and last stage of Counter Stake, Matic's incentivized testnet staking program. This is the stage where we will encourage validators and the community to perform "Attacks" and "Break the system" notions. In order to know about Stage 2, you can join our discord channel for more details: https://discord.gg/XvpHAxZ
