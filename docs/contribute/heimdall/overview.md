Heimdall is heart of the Matic system. It manages validators, spans and state-sync and other essentials aspects of the system.

It uses the Cosmos-SDK and forked version of Tendermint, called Peppermint. Peppermint source: [https://github.com/maticnetwork/tendermint/tree/peppermint](https://github.com/maticnetwork/tendermint/tree/peppermint) 

Heimdall removes some of the modules from Cosmos-SDK but mostly it uses customised version of it but follows the same pattern.
