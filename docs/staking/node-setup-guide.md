The Proof-of-Stake layer in the Matic Network architecture serves the following 2 purposes:

* Acts as an incentivization layer for maintaining liveness of the Plasma chain, chiefly mitigating the thorny issue of data unavailability

* Implement the Proof-of-Stake security guarantees for state transitions not covered by Plasma

The role of validators is to run a validator node for which they need to install and run Heimdall and Bor.

This guide explains how to setup your node and connect to an existing testnet which will later be updated with the mainnet details. 

Please follow the steps here to understand more. Using this, you will be able to sync with an existing testnet and query network status. We'll soon update this with Staking contract information once we're ready to have you as a validator in the current pool.
