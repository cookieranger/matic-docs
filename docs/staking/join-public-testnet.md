Instructions on how to join public testnet

You need to install [Heimdall](https://docs.matic.network/staking/heimdall/install-heimdall) and [Bor](https://docs.matic.network/staking/install-bor) before you proceed any further. 

As soon as we start the public testnet event you would be able to see the genesis file and other required configurations and seed-nodes here.

### Join Pre Stage-0 Testnet

Genesis files, Seed Nodes for Pre stage-0 are available here.

#### Start & Sync Heimdall

Once heimdall is build and initialised, 

**Heimdall genesis Config**

```js
$ git clone https://github.com/maticnetwork/public-testnets
$ cd public-testnets/pre-stage0

// copy genesis file to config directory
$ cp heimdall-genesis.json ~/.heimdalld/config/genesis.json 

// copy config file to config directory
$ cp heimdall-config.toml ~/.heimdalld/config/heimdall-config.toml

```

**Configure Peers**

Peers are the other nodes you want to sync to in order to maintain your full node. You can add peers separated by commas in file at `~/.heimdalld/config/config.toml` under `persistent_peers` with the format `NodeID@IP:PORT` or `NodeID@DOMAIN:PORT` 

Refer to `seeds.txt` for peer info in your testnet folder.

You can start heimdall and other associated services now using the link below!

#### Start & Sync Bor

**Initialise genesis block**

```js
// go to bor-config directory
$ cd bor-config

// Using genesis file of validator bor node
$ cp ../pre-stage0/bor-genesis.json genesis.json 

// initialize Genesis Block
$ $GOPATH/src/github.com/maticnetwork/bor/build/bin --datadir dataDir init genesis.json 
 
 ```

**Configure Static nodes**

You can configure permanent static nodes by putting something like the following into `<datadir>/bor/static-nodes.json`with the format `pubkey@IP:PORT` or `pubkey@DOMAIN:PORT`

Refer `seeds.txt` for the enode url to use in the `static-nodes.json` file.

```js
[
  "enode://15b76114a7949bb74e0db919cf34db7cec67902ba596c4b22e82502f60f5d21d0d10c61e0db6bf0b2bfa5a358356aba38107a4f533a908c4463a928047a3b83a@34.202.53.230:30303"
]
```

**Start bor**

```js
$ bash start.sh

```

Your `bor-node` should be syncing now! Checkout `logs/bor.log` to get to the logs ðŸ¤©
