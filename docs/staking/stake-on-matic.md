# How to Stake and Become a Validator on Matic (Stage 1 Counter Stake)

This is a step-by-step guide to help you become a validator on Matic's incentivised testnet program. The following list of commands will help you setup your heimdall and bor nodes for staking and performing validator duties.


## Pre-requisites:

You should have Heimdall and Bor setups up and running on your machine. If you haven't yet set it up, you can do so by reading this guide: [https://docs.matic.network/staking/participate-in-counter-stake/](https://docs.matic.network/staking/participate-in-counter-stake/)

### Generate Bor keystore file

To generate the keystore file for Bor, run the following command:

    heimdallcli generate-keystore <private-key>

The private key required over here is the address of the one which has the tokens that you're going to stake. Make sure you add a prefix of '0x' to the beginning of the private key.

Once you run this command you will be requested for a passphrase. A passphrase can be considered as password too. This passphrase will be used to encrypt the keystore file.

This will create a keystore file in UTC format. For example: 

    UTC--2020-02-10T10-11-48.027180000Z--6c468cf8c9879006e22ec4029696e005c2319c9d

Do `ls` here and you will see the file name in the above format.

Now you will have to move the keystore file to bor data directory.

    mv ./UTC-<time>-<address> $BORDIR/keystore/

### Generate Heimdall private key

To generate a private key for your validator, run the following command:

    heimdallcli generate-validatorkey <private-key>

This will create **priv_validator_key.json i**n the same folder.

Move this validator key file to heimdall config folder.

    mv ./priv_validator_key.json $HEIMDALLDIR/config 

### Account information

First you do a basic check on your account information by running the below command:

    heimdalld show-account

The following output should appear:

    {
        "address": "0x6c468CF8c9879006E22EC4029696E005C2319C9D",
        "pub_key": "0x04b12d8b2f6e3d45a7ace12c4b2158f79b95e4c28ebe5ad54c439be9431d7fc9dc1164210bf6a5c3b8523528b931e772c86a307e8cff4b725e6b4a77d21417bf19"
    }

This will display your address and public key for your validator node. **Note that this address must match with your signer address on Ethereum.**

### Show private key

Then you to do another check for your private-key by running the following command. Note that this is an **optional** step and need not be a mandatory step:

    heimdalld show-privatekey

The following output should appear:

    {
        "priv_key": "0x********************************************************"
    }

Now that you have done a basic health check and generated the keystore and private key for Bor and Heimdall respectively, you can now proceed to staking your tokens on Matic and become a validator.

## Stake on Ethereum chain

**Approve**

The `approve` command will initiate your transaction towards staking on Matic.

`approve` Matic tokens to `StakeManager` Stake amount and fee amount must be in 18 decimals â€” `1000000000000000000` is 1 Matic token. Note that stake and fee amount must be greater than 10 Matic tokens.

    heimdallcli approve --staked-amount <stake-amount>  --fee-amount <heimdall-fee-amount>

Once you run the approve command you should see the following response along with the transaction hash.

    Sent approve tx sucessfully txHash=0x987aa9a319de34f61b768e4bbac160212055d8e5e9b813b2fc520dc650488943

To check the status of the transaction, you paste the `txHash` on this link: [https://ropsten.etherscan.io/](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/)

**Stake**

Once `approve` transaction gets confirmed, send `stake` transaction on Ethereum.

`--validator` is owner address of validator node. Your owner address is the same address as your wallet address from which you initiated your staking transaction.

Owner can manage stake, rewards and manage signer address for the validator. Signer address will be same as your address on node. You can always change your signer address.

    heimdallcli stake --staked-amount <stake-amount>  --fee-amount <heimdall-fee-amount> --validator <validator-owner-address>

You should see the following response once you run the above command

    Submitted stake sucessfully txHash=0x987aa9a319de34f61b768e4bbac160212055d8e5e9b813b2fc520dc650488943

To check the status of the transaction, you paste the `txHash` on this link: [https://ropsten.etherscan.io/](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/)

### Balance

To check the balance of your address:

You can find details regarding chain id over here: https://github.com/maticnetwork/public-testnets/tree/master/CS-2001

    ./build/heimdallcli query auth account <signer-address> --chain-id <chain-id>

The following output should appear:

    address: 0x6c468cf8c9879006e22ec4029696e005c2319c9d
      coins:
      - denom: matic
        amount:
          i: "1000000000000000000000"
      accountnumber: 0
      sequence: 0

Please note that you need to keep checking if you balance has been updated with tokens or not. If you initiate Validator Join before without any tokens, you will error out. 

### Validator join

Once you have adequate balance to pay fees on Heimdall, you can join the network by running the following command:

    ./build/heimdallcli tx staking validator-join --signer-pubkey <signer-pub-key> --tx-hash <stake-etheruem-tx-hash> --chain-id <chain-id>

### Validator information

**By signer address**

    heimdallcli query staking validator-info --validator=0x6c468cf8c9879006e22ec4029696e005c2319c9d --chain-id <chain-id>

This command should display the following output:

    {
    	"ID":1,
    	"startEpoch":0,
    	"endEpoch":0,
    	"power":10,
    	"pubKey":"0x04b12d8b2f6e3d45a7ace12c4b2158f79b95e4c28ebe5ad54c439be9431d7fc9dc1164210bf6a5c3b8523528b931e772c86a307e8cff4b725e6b4a77d21417bf19",
    	"signer":"0x6c468cf8c9879006e22ec4029696e005c2319c9d",
    	"last_updated":0,
    	"accum":0
    }

**By validator id**

    heimdallcli query staking validator-info --id=1 --chain-id=<chain-id>

This command will print output in format as "validator by signer address" command.
