# Setup Matic Validator Node

## We strongly recommend not using a laptop if you are running a full node.

### Step 1: Install GO

Install go by following the [official docs](https://golang.org/doc/install). Remember to set your `$GOPATH`, `$GOBIN`, and `$PATH` environment variables, for example:

```js
$ mkdir -p $HOME/go/bin
$ echo "export GOPATH=$HOME/go" >> ~/.bash_profile
$ source ~/.bash_profile
$ echo "export GOBIN=$GOPATH/bin" >> ~/.bash_profile
$ source ~/.bash_profile
$ echo "export PATH=$PATH:$GOBIN" >> ~/.bash_profile
$ source ~/.bash_profile

```

Or we have a script to install go for you

```js

$ curl https://gist.githubusercontent.com/vaibhavchellani/cbe0fa947dc0a6557cb9583d081ff8ce/raw/d47b3df14ccffdd7a965e44c39fb5ec235360166/new.sh > install_go.sh
$ bash install_go.sh

```

> Note: Go version 1.11+ is recommended

### Step 2: Install RabbitMq

> NOTE: You do not need rabbit-mq for stage-0 so you can choose to skip.

A helper service called `bridge` which is embedded into heimdall codebase requires `rabbit-mq` to queue transactions to multiple networks. Installing it should be pretty straightforward. Checkout the download instructions [here](https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html).

```js

$ rabbitmq-server

```

### Step 3: Install make

You need to install `make` to run some commands. Using the below commands you can install `make` depending on your system.

**For Ubuntu**

```
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

**For MacOS**

```
$ brew install make
```

### Step 4: Install Heimdall

Next, let's install the latest version of Heimdall. Here, we'll use the master branch, which contains the latest stable release. If necessary, make sure you `git checkout` the correct [released version](https://github.com/maticnetwork/heimdall/releases)

```js
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/maticnetwork
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/maticnetwork
$ git clone https://github.com/maticnetwork/heimdall
$ cd heimdall

// Checkout to a public-testnet version.
// For eg: git checkout CS-2001
$ git checkout <TAG OR BRANCH>
$ make install
```

That will install the `heimdalld` and `heimdallcli` binaries. Verify that everything is OK:

```bash
$ heimdalld --help
```

**Set up a new node**

```bash
$ heimdalld init
$ echo "export HEIMDALLDIR=~/.heimdalld" >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

This will emit the following output which shows your node id and chain id, these can be changed before starting a chain from the genesis file.

```bash
{
  "chain_id": "heimdall-pldzov",
  "node_id": "ae8fd49c192f39a400c00b328d4fd109d5bcb71d"
}
```

### Step 5: Install Bor

```js

$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/maticnetwork
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/maticnetwork
$ git clone https://github.com/maticnetwork/bor
$ cd bor
// Checkout to a public-testnet version.
// For eg: git checkout CS-2001
$ git checkout <TAG OR BRANCH>
$ make bor

```

Now you have `bor` installed on your local system and the binary is available in the path `build/bin/bor`

<!-- #CHECK following step is the same as in running-with-docker -->

### Step 6: Join public testnet

#### 6.1: Get Heimdall genesis config

```js
$ git clone https://github.com/maticnetwork/public-testnets

//NOTE: Do make sure to join the relevant folder
$ cd public-testnets/<testnet version>
// Current testnet version is CS-2001
// Example: $ cd public-testnets/CS-2001

$ echo "export CONFIGPATH=$PWD" >> ~/.bashrc

$ source ~/.bashrc

// copy genesis file to config directory
$ cp $CONFIGPATH/heimdall/config/genesis.json  $HEIMDALLDIR/config/genesis.json

// copy config file to config directory
$ cp $CONFIGPATH/heimdall/config/heimdall-config.toml $HEIMDALLDIR/config/heimdall-config.toml
```

> NOTE: In case you do not have a ropsten API key, generate one using: https://ethereumico.io/knowledge-base/infura-api-key-guide

Add your API key in file `~/.heimdalld/config/heimdall-config.toml` under the key `"eth_RPC_URL"`.

**Generate Heimdall private key**

If you have received Matic tokens as part of Counter-stake. You need to generate validator key to participate.

To generate a private key for your validator, run the following command:

    heimdallcli generate-validatorkey <private-key>

This will create **priv_validator_key.json** in the same folder.

Move this validator key file to heimdall config folder.

    mv ./priv_validator_key.json $HEIMDALLDIR/config

#### 6.2: Configure peers for Heimdall

Peers are the other nodes you want to sync to in order to maintain your full node. You can add peers separated by commas in file at `~/.heimdalld/config/config.toml` under `persistent_peers` with the format `NodeID@IP:PORT` or `NodeID@DOMAIN:PORT`

Refer to `heimdall/heimdall-seeds.txt` for peer info in your testnet folder, i.e. `$CONFIGPATH/heimdall`.

#### 6.3: Start & sync Heimdall

Before starting do verify you are on the correct version by running the below command

```bash
$ heimdallcli version --long
```

<!-- #CHECK following `run` commands are same as in deploy-your-own-testnet -->

**Run Heimdall**

Starting Heimdall is fairly easy, the below command will start heimdall using the genesis file in `~/.heimdalld/config/genesis.json`.

```js

$ heimdalld start

```

**Run rest-server**

The rest-server can be used by external services like explorer, faucets etc to connect to heimdall chain for fetching data and sending transactions.

```js
$ heimdalld rest-server
```

**Run Bridge**

Bridge is a helper package that sends transactions to heimdall on behalf of validators. All interactions with other chains happens via this bridge.

```bash
$ bridge start --all
```

> Note: Bridge won't run without `rabbitmq` and `rest-server` so ensure they are running before trying to run bridge.

**Reset Heimdall**

> NOTE: To be used only if you need to restart Heimdall and delete old data in the event of a crash or if there are changes in genesis files.

Use the following to delete blockchain data and reset everything.

```bash
$ heimdalld unsafe-reset-all
$ rm -rf $HEIMDALLDIR/bridge
```

**Check sync status**

To check the sync status you can run the follwing command on your node

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:26657/status

// Output
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "",
  "result": {
    "node_info": {
      "protocol_version": {
        "p2p": "7",
        "block": "10",
        "app": "0"
      },
      "id": "c4abb0ddd80a413f35f9db2d5b4bc573417b95c4",
      "listen_addr": "tcp://0.0.0.0:26656",
      "network": "heimdall-wOVEJp",
      "version": "0.31.5",
      "channels": "4020212223303800",
      "moniker": "Vaibhavs-MacBook-Air.local",
      "other": {
        "tx_index": "on",
        "rpc_address": "tcp://0.0.0.0:26657"
      }
    },
    "sync_info": {
      "latest_block_hash": "E9219F1FBE049B19A919FBF39F46600ADCD7B690C29C92B37408F36046E51C1A",

      "latest_block_height": "3",
      "latest_block_time": "2019-12-12T06:45:29.823953Z",
      "catching_up": false
    },
    "validator_info": {
      "address": "EE9DF712A0D9D09A79525ABF05E72D44F796EDD3",
      "pub_key": {

      },
      "voting_power": "10"
    }
  }
}
```

The key called `catching_up` will show your sync status, if it's not catching up it means that you are fully synced!

**Expected Output**

Your `heimdall-node` should be syncing now! Checkout `$GOPATH/src/github.com/maticnetwork/heimdall/logs/heimdalld.log` to get to the logs ðŸ¤©

If everything's well, then your logs should look something like this:

![Screenshot](./images/expected-heimdall.png)

#### 6.4: Initialise genesis block for Bor

```js

// Go to 'public-testnets' and testnet version
$ cd $CONFIGPATH/bor

// initialize Genesis Block and peers
$ bash setup.sh

$ echo "export BORDIR=~/.bor" >> ~/.bashrc
```

This will create Bor home directory at `~/.bor` and data directory at `~/.bor/dataDir`

#### 6.5: Configure peers for Bor

To sync blocks on the testnet, you need to add peers. The file `static-nodes.json` in your relevant public-testnets version folder contains information for all the available seed nodes. It will be already copied using `bash setup.sh` command.

**Adding additional peers (optional)**

If you have certain peers you always want to connect to, you can configure permanent static nodes by putting something like the following example into `~/.bor/dataDir/bor/static-nodes.json`

```bash
[
  "enode://f4642fa65af50cfdea8fa7414a5def7bb7991478b768e296f5e4a54e8b995de102e0ceae2e826f293c481b5325f89be6d207b003382e18a8ecba66fbaf6416c0@33.4.2.1:30303",
  "enode://ENODEID@ip:port"
]
```

For more info on how to connect to peers see [this](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/peer-to-peer).

**Generate Bor keystore file**

To generate the keystore file for Bor, run the following command:

```bash
heimdallcli generate-keystore <private-key>
```

The private key required over here is the address of the one which has the tokens that you're going to stake. 

Once you run this command you will be requested for a passphrase. A passphrase can be considered as password too. This passphrase will be used to encrypt the keystore file.

This will create a keystore file in UTC format. For example:

```
UTC--2020-02-10T10-11-48.027180000Z--6c468cf8c9879006e22ec4029696e005c2319c9d
```

Do `ls` here and you will see the file name in the above format.

Now you will have to move the keystore file to bor data directory.

```bash
mv ./UTC-<time>-<address> ~/.bor/keystore/
```

**Add password.txt**

Add the password that you entered in the password.txt file

```
$ vim ~/.bor/password.txt
```

Add phrase you choose during generating key store file in `password.txt`

#### 6.7: Start Bor

```js
// You'll find the following in bor-config directory
$ bash start.sh <Your address>
```

**Expected Output**

Your `bor-node` should be syncing now! Checkout `~/.bor/logs/bor.log` to get to the logs ðŸ¤©

If everything's well, then your logs should look something like this:

![Screenshot](./images/expected-bor.png)

**Ta-Da**

If your `Heimdall` and `Bor` logs are fine, that your node setup is complete. Congratulations on reaching so far!

Once you are done checking the logs or querying the data, you may stop all services and restart again soon as we start staking in the next stage.

#### 6.8: Query data

To see examples on how to query your full node and get network status, please refer here: https://api.matic.network/staking/cs1001/swagger-ui/
