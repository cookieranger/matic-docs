Assets can be transferred in between root chain & child chain. Let me be first clear regarding nomenclature

- Root chain/ Base chain/ Parent chain/ Layer 1 :: all are same, denoting to either Goerli or Ethereum Mainnet
- Child chain/ Layer 2 :: denotes either Matic Mumbai or Matic Matic Mainnet

To submit such a custom token for mapping, submit the form [here](/docs/develop/ethereum-matic/submit-mapping-request). Please make note that this mapping submission form is for Plasma Bridge and for PoS bridge you have to directly contact the matic team on discord.
