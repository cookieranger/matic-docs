>Arkane, for developers looking to dive into blockchain technology.


**Arkane** allows you to easily integrate your app with the Matic blockchain, whether you already have an app integrated with web3 or are building a new application from scratch. Arkane provides a smooth and delightful experience for you, your users on both web and mobile.

Arkane will help you interact with the Matic blockchain, create blockchain wallets, create different asset types such as fungible (ERC20), and non-fungible tokens (ERC721, and ERC1155) and interact with smart contracts. Next to a superior developer experience, you can give your users a user-friendly interface.

Each application is unique and has different needs, therefore they provide different ways of interacting with Arkane. Applications that have support for Web3 are recommendated to integrate the [Arkane Web3 provider](https://arkane.gitbook.io/widget/web3-provider/getting-started), others are suggested to use the [Arkane Widget](https://arkane.gitbook.io/widget/widget/introduction).
