In general, for interacting with Ethereum DApps users need to have enough Ether in their account, which requires them to go through lengthy KYC procedure; then buying Ether & start interacting - not a good UX. 

That's where GSN comes into picture with an interesting proposal for improving DApp UX, where gas less transactions can be sent to Ethereum network & user requests to be funded by some party other than user.
