Scalable Relayer Infrastructure for Blockchain Transactions.

## intro

Biconomy is a scalable transaction relayer infrastructure, which can pay blockchain transaction's gas fee for your dApp user, while collecting fees from you on monthly basis, in form of some stable token.

Meta Transactions can be crafted in any of following two ways.

### Contract based Accounts

In this approach, for each user an upgradable contract wallet is created, which acts as a proxy contract & relays all transactions to destination smart contract. As user needs to keep all of their assets under supervision of this proxy contract, all blockchain transactions to be routed via this proxy contract.

### Native Meta Transactions

If dApps support native meta transactions, then biconomy relayers can directly talk to dApp contract, where we don't need any user specific contract wallet.

## integration

Biconomy offers their SDK that makes this integration seamless, called Mexa.

Integration with Mexa is a two step process:

1. Register your DApp on Mexa Dashboard, a dashboard for developers, and copy API Key generated for your DApp.
2. Integrate Mexa SDK in your DApp code using API Key you got from dashboard.

You'll first need your deployed smart contract address and it's ABI to register on the dashboard.

### dashboard

Follow the steps **[here](https://docs.biconomy.io/biconomy-dashboard)**, to register an account and add a DApp to get the keys, and configure functions that will accept signed transactions.

### using mexa

Get inside dApp client code directory, to configure meta transactions. Lets first install `@biconomy/mexa` from npm.

```js
npm install @biconomy/mexa --save
```

Now we can initialize biconomy & web3. In place of `<web3 provider>` you can use `window.ethereum` if your dApp users are using MetaMask.

```js
import Biconomy from "@biconomy/mexa";

const biconomy = new Biconomy(<web3 provider>, {apiKey: <API Key>});
web3 = new Web3(biconomy);

biconomy.onEvent(biconomy.READY, () => {

  // Initialize your dapp here like getting user accounts etc

}).onEvent(biconomy.ERROR, (error, message) => {

  // Handle error while initializing mexa

});
```

Congratulations üëè

You have now enabled meta transactions in your DApp. Interact with web3 the way you have been doing it.

Now whenever there is a write transaction action(registered in mexa dashboard also) initiated from the user, mexa will ask for user‚Äôs signature in an [EIP-712](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-712.md) format and handle the transaction rather than sending signed transaction directly to blockchain from user‚Äôs wallet.

### next

You can go through [this](https://github.com/bcnmy/dapp-demo) example for getting an in depth overview of native meta transactions.
