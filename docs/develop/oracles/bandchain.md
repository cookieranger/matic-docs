Band Protocol allows you to query data from traditional web APIs and use it in the blockchain. Developers can make query through BandChain, a cosmos-based blockchain for facilitating oracle requests and payment, and then use the data on the dApp through inter-chain communication. Integrating oracle data can be done in 3 simple steps:

1. Choosing the oracle scripts
2. Requesting Data from BandChain
3. Using the data in smart contracts

### Usage

- Band Protocol Supports Matic TestnetV3: ```0x3ba819b03fb8d34995f68304946eefa6dcff7cbf```.
