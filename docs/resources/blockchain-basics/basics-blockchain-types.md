Following are the major types of blockchain networks:

1. Private Blockchain Network <br></br>
Private Blockchain are run and controlled by a single organisation that determines who can read, write and participate in consensus process. Since they are 100% centralised, private blockchain is useful for sandbox environments and not for Production.

2. Semi-private Blockchain Network <br></br>
This network is run by a single company that grants access to any user who satisfy pre-established criteria. Although it not truly decentralised, this solution is appealing to business-to-business use cases and government applications.

3. Consortium Blockchain Network <br></br>
In consortium blockchain, the consensus process in handled by a group of people. The right to read and write maybe public or restricted to a participant. Consortium blockchain are considered to be "permissioned blockchains" and best suited for organisations and enterprises.  

4. Public Blockchain Network <br></br>
Anyone can read, write transaction to the network, or participate in the consensus process. They are considered to be "permissionless". Every transaction is public, and user can remain anonymous.
