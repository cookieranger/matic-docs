title: New to Matic?
---


Matic Network is a scaling solution for public blockchains. Based on an adapted implementation of Plasma framework (Plasma MoreVP) - with an account based implementation (read more [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/account-based-plasma-morevp/5480)), Matic supports all the existing Ethereum tooling along with faster and cheaper transactions.

If you are Ethereum Developer then you are already a Matic Developer. You don't have to worry about anything. Just deploy your contracts on Matic within Two simple steps.

### Deploy smart contracts

<!-- ### Are you an Experience Blockchain Developer? -->

* Deploy your Contracts on Matic Network
    - [Using Remix](/docs/develop/remix)
    - [Using Truffle](/docs/develop/truffle)
* Configure the Web3 RPC-URL to https://testnetv3.matic.network, *Everything else remains the same*
>  Matic Mainnet will have PoS security, with greater Plasma guarantees being added

**And Volla!!! Enjoy the Scalable and Instant Solutions with almost no cost with the security of Blockchain.**

### What is a Blockchain?
Simply put, Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger for recording transactions, tracking assets and building trust. Head over to [Blockchain Basics](blockchain-basics/blockchain) to read more.

### What is a Sidechain?
Think of Sidechain is a clone of 'parent' blockchain, supporting transfer of assets to and fro the main chain. It is simply an alternate to parent chain that creates a new blockchain with its own mechanism of creating blocks (consensus mechanism). Connecting a sidechain to a parent chain involves setting up a method of moving assets between the chains.

### What is Plasma?
Plasma is a framework of secondary chains that will communicate and interact as sparingly as possible with the main chain. Child chain are a scaling solution for Ethereum (or any blockchain for that matter).
It is a layer 2 solution for Ethereum that provides a framework for building ‘off-chain’ decentralised applications that are secure, scalable and swift.
