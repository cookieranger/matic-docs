The global state of Ethereum is comprised of accounts that interact with one another through a message-passing framework. The most basic interaction is that of sending some value - like matic tokens, ether - the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum blockchain.
Each account is identified by a 20 byte identifier which is called an address - this is the public key of the account.
There exist two types of accounts:

1. Externally Owned Account - the private key to which is owned by a person (eg., youâ€™d own the private key and be responsible to keep it safe)
2. Contract Owned Account - has an associated code with it and is not owned by a person

These can be differentiated as follows:

**Externally Owned Accounts** 

1. can send transactions (ether transfer or trigger contract code)
2. is controlled by private keys
3. has no associated code

**Contract Owned Accounts** 

1. has associated code
2. code execution is triggered by transactions or messages (calls) received from other contracts
3. when executed - perform operations of arbitrary complexity (Turing completeness) - manipulate its own persistent storage, i.e., can have its own permanent state - can call other contracts.
