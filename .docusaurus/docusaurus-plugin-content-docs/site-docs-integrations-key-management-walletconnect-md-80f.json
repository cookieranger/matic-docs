  "description": "Wallet Connect is an open protocol - not a wallet - built to create a communication link between DApps and Wallets. A wallet and an application supporting this protocol will enable a secure link through a shared key between the two peers. A connection is initiated by the DApp displaying a QR code with a standard WalletConnect URI and the connection is established when the wallet application approves the connection request. Further requests regarding funds transfer are confirmed on the wallet application itself.",
