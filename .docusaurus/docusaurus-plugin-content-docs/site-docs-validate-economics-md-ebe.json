  "description": "Matic is a Layer 2 scaling solution for public blockchains. It uses an account based variant of More Viable Plasma to guarantee the security of assets on the main-chain and it ensures the security of generic transactions by using a decentralized network of Proof-of-Stake validators. The system is designed to enable quicker partial confirmations for better user experience while the final confirmation is attained periodically as the checkpoints are committed on the main-chain.  ",
